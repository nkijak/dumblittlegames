# Mirror Game

Use player's input with random mutations/fuzz (reverse steering, increase/decrease turn radius, inverse stop/go mechanics, etc) as "AI" for enemy ships.

## Phaser.js version
Uses phaser.js framework and assets.  Taken from online IDE. Not sure how to load locally.

### TODO
* Figure out how to load phaser.js from local file
* Get assets locally
